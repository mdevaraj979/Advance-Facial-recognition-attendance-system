The Facial Attendance System aims to automate the process of attendance marking in educational institutions or workplaces using facial recognition technology. This project utilizes Python programming language, SQL database management, and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm for facial recognition.

Features:
Facial recognition using LBPH algorithm for accurate identification.
Database management using SQL for storing and managing student/employee information and attendance records.
User-friendly interface for administrators to manage the system and view attendance reports.
Real-time attendance tracking.

Technologies Used:
Python: for programming the backend logic, facial recognition, and interface development.
SQL: for database management, storing student/employee information, and attendance records.
LBPH Algorithm: for facial recognition, providing robustness against various lighting conditions and facial expressions.
OpenCV library: for image processing and implementing the LBPH algorithm.
Tkinter or Flask: for creating the user interface.

Workflow:
Registration: Initially, individuals need to be registered in the system. Their facial images along with other necessary information such as name, ID, etc., are stored in the database.
Attendance Marking: During attendance sessions, the system captures the facial image of individuals.
Facial Recognition: The captured facial images are processed using the LBPH algorithm to recognize individuals.
Database Interaction: The system interacts with the SQL database to match recognized faces with registered individuals and mark their attendance.

The Facial Attendance System using Python, SQL, and LBPH algorithm offers a modern and efficient solution for attendance management.
By leveraging facial recognition technology, it simplifies the attendance tracking process, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy in educational institutions or workplaces.
